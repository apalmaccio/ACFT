# Aether Cosmological Field Theory (ACFT) Code Database

This repository contains code, data, and documentation for the Aether Cosmological Field Theory (ACFT), a static universe model with phase transition dynamics. The code reproduces results from the manuscript by Alexander Palmaccio (2025), addressing cosmological observables like CMB distance, BAO scale, BBN yields, structure growth, and solar-system constraints.
